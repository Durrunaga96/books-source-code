This folder contains listings provided to students using Java Software Structures.  These include the code listings as they appear in the text and the exceptions in the jss2.exceptions package.The file, STUDENTsourceCode.xls  contains an index to all of the file listings provided. The listings are organized in this index by chapter but are organized in the zip file by package.  Listings appear in the appropriate folder, either the main Instructor's Code folder or one of the subordinate folders if the listing is in a package.Each column of the index provides additional information about the listing as described in the column headings:  Filename, Package (also the name of the subordinate folder in which the file is located), whether the listing appears in the completely or partially in the text, and Explanatory Notes.The code provided to students only includes the code printed in the text.  The one exception to this is the jss2.exceptions folder/package.  This package is provided to students but is not printed in the text.
